```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This div now has a red background and is displayed horizontally.
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This div now has a blue background and is displayed horizontally.
  </div>
</div>
```
Adding the `flex` class to the parent `<div>` correctly enables flexbox layout, causing the child divs to arrange themselves horizontally as intended.
